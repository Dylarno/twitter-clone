I chose to make the home and profile pages for twitter.com. As these are the main pages of the website, these are the ones I chose to replicate. I picked out reusable components that were on both pages, such as nav-left, tweet and footer as I would be able to get the most use out of them.

My components were broken up by how much content they contain, if that content should be customizable or not, and how much they're going to be reused. For example, the Tweet component was a no-brainer prop. The avatar, display name, username and the tweet text all need to be customizeable, as they can be different from tweet to tweet. Twitter also displays thousands of tweets, and needs to be able to display them quickily and easily.

I did not realize that there wasn't supposed to be any functionality, and spent a lot of time trying to create a functionality where you could type in tweets and send them to the feed. Unfortunately this took time away for me to add more styles and create a proper database for dummy data.
